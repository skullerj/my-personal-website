# Juan Rosero's Personal Website

The source code for my personal website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and custom design. This site serves as a showcase of my development skills while providing a playground for experimenting with new technologies, designs, and development processes.

## Development Philosophy

This project serves as a real-world test of the [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) methodology by Basecamp. I've embraced this approach to work in focused cycles, shaping up specific features and committing to short release periods.

Initially, I set out to create highly animated and interactive experiences using GSAP. Through investigation and experimentation, I discovered that Astro's current capabilities aligned perfectly with my goals, allowing me to build efficiently without overcomplicating the stack.

## Tech Stack

- **[Astro](https://astro.build)** - Static site generator and web framework
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **[GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/)** - Animation library for interactive experiences
- **React** - Included in the project but currently unused

## Future Plans

I plan to continue developing this site using the Shape Up methodology, working in focused slates with clear boundaries and outcomes. Upcoming considerations include:

- Adding links to other projects and portfolio pieces
- Potentially creating a blog section
- Continued experimentation with animations and interactions
- Exploring new technologies as they align with the site's goals

## Getting Started

Originally inspired by [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper), though the codebase has evolved significantly from its initial foundation. The current implementation represents original work and design decisions.
