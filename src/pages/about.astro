        You know those grumpy faces that you get on the tube at 7:43am when
        going to work? well, that’s not me. I like bringing a little sunshine to
        the world, even when it’s grim. That’s what drives me and luckily I get
        to bring that shine to people using websites sometimes, which is why I
        love what I do.
