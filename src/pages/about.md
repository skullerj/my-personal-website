## Hello there!

I'm Juan, the author of this blog. On this corner you will find more info about and the reason for this website to exist.

First, let me thank you for being here. This website has been in the making for a long time. One of those projects that you never end up publishing and always change direction.

## Why this blog?

The motivation is just to push myself to do something that I find amusing to create while hopefully lighting someone else brain with an interesting idea I stumbled upon.

## About the Juan and Only

I started building websites in Quito, around 2016, when a friend of mine got us a job to create a rental listings website. The person who hired us just wanted to cut on costs so she was fine with us still studying at our University and not having any real-world experience. From that point, it has just been one job after the other and now I'm working for a company in the UK but living in Lisbon.

On a day to day basis I work with:

- React
- JavaScript and TypeScript
- GraphQL

And here are some stuff I'm trying to incorporate

- Rust
- Astro, as you can see with this blog

If you have something to share with me, don't hesitate to drop me an [email](mailto:juan@roser.dev).
