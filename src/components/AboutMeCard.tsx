                I'm Juan, a Front End / Full Stack Developer specialized in{" "}
                <strong>React</strong>. I made my first website back on 2016 for
                a friend and those skills got me a job, which got me the next
                one and so on. That learn and grow path has continued ever
                since. Now, I get to this for a living and I'm grateful about
                it. <br /> <br />I like programming and design in general. Iâ€™m
                trying to impress you right now using those skills my dear
                reader, and of course also trying to get a little giggle out of
                you as well.
