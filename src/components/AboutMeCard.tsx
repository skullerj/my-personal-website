        I'm Juan, a Front End / Full Stack Developer specialized in{" "}
        <strong>React</strong>. I made my first website back on 2016 for a
        friend and those skills got me a job, which got me the next one and so
        on. That learn and grow path has continued ever since. Now, I get to
        this for a living and I'm grateful about it. <br /> <br />I like
        programming and design in general. Iâ€™m trying to impress you right now
        using those skills my dear reader, and of course also trying to get a
        little giggle out of you as well.
